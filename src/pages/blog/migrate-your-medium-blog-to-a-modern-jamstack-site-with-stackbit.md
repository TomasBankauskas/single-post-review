## TL;DR

We're glad to announce the release of our [Medium importer](https://www.stackbit.com/medium/) - instantly create a modern JAMstack website from an existing Medium blog.

## Why are some people leaving Medium

Medium offers a fantastic writing experience; however, you may have noticed a growing trend of folks looking to move over to more open stacks where they can have full control of their content and how its displayed/shared/monetized. It's part data ownership and portability, part people realizing how their site/blog is core to their online identity and them wanting more control over it which is awesome. What's really great is that the modern web is evolving in a way that gives people the ability to separate content/editing from presentation and publishing. You don't have to give up control of your content, limit yourself to publishing on a specific domain or avoid styling your online persona the way you like.

## Stackbit and the JAMstack

Stackbit enables people to create modern JAMstack sites in 60 seconds by offering themes and handling all the provisioning/wiring. Now with the Medium importer you can go from a Medium blog to your own Gatsby site on Netlify with a Forestry.io CMS back-end, or any other combination thereof in about a minute. We're also beta testing three new Stackbit themes which offer a clean and functional starting point for blogs. We should be ready to incorporate the new themes into the main Stackbit flow next week, you can expect a blog post with some background on why and how we decided to create them. In the mean time here are some screenshots of _Fjord_, _Ampersand_ and _Fresh_:
