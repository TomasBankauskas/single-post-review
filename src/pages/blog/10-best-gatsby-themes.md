  Exploring some of the best options for free and open source Gatsby themes to
  help you get started on your next Gatsby Jamstack site.

One of Gatsby's strengths is in the size of its community and ecosystem of plugins. This means that there are a lot of themes for a Gatsby developer to choose from as a starting point for their new project. In fact, as of this writing, there are 211 themes listed on the [Jamstack Themes site](https://jamstackthemes.dev/), which aims to be comprehensive resource for themes across all Jamstack tools.

To help you out, I went through all [211 themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/#ssg=gatsby) and picked my personal top 10. Obviously, these are in part based on my own personal aesthetic preferences, but I also took into account the features of the theme. For instance, does it support a CMS? Does it have unique capabilities? Is it only a port of a another theme? So, with that in mind, here are my favorites, in no particular order.

## [Azimuth](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=azimuth)

[![Azimuth](/images/themes/azimuth-gatsby-theme.png)](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=azimuth)

**By**: Stackbit<br>
**Demo**: <https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/azimuth/><br>
**Supported CMS**: Sanity, DatoCMS, Contentful, NetlifyCMS<br>

This is one of my favorite of our Stackbit templates. It's designed for a business like a SaaS service, for example. I should note that to use this with Gatsby, you'll have to generate the site using the [Stackbit site builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create), which is free.
