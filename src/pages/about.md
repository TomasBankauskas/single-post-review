      The way we create and engineer websites is changing thanks to the constant
      evolution of tools, best practices and needs. They're being statically
      generated, served from CDNs, edited using Headless CMS and wired up with a
      myriad of developer workflows. 


      New ideas like the Jamstack, serverless computing and git-based workflows
      are creating a more performant and secure web. We believe these
      performance and security benefits don't need to require tradeoffs in the
      ease of editing and managing sites. At Stackbit, we're building the tools
      that make managing modern websites easy, so we can all make the web,
      better.

      We are a lean team of explorers, builders, scientists and just plain
      curious folks who live and breathe the Jamstack. 


      We decided to tackle the massive challenge of orchestrating an
      ever-growing set of tools that need to play nicely together, and we keep
      this in mind with every project we decide to take on. 


      At Stackbit, you will have the prerogative to make things happen, along
      with empowerment to determine what these "things" are. You will be part of
      a flat, fully distributed organization, with an uncanny entrepreneurial
      spirit and relentless motivation to move the needle where it counts. 


      We help each other, uplift each other, and rely on each other's feedback
      and expertise to inform our choices and help us make the web, better.
