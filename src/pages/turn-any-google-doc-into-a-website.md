          No cumbersome CMS, no uploading, building, hosting, or syncing
          mumbo-jumbo. Design your layout and content in Google Docs and let
          Stackbit do the magic for you. It’s never been easier and, frankly, we see
          no reason why it shouldn’t be.

          When it comes to editing, just open your Google Doc and edit as usual.
          When ready, just go to Stackbit’s widget and hit Publish. Your updated
          site will be out in the wild before you can say “Why wasn’t it always like
          that?"
