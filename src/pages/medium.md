                You may have noticed the recent movement of people looking to get off
                Medium. Most of us are motivated by a desire to own our content, have
                data portability and get more control over how and where our content
                is displayed and monetized. Most importantly, many of us consider our
                blog or wesite to be a core part of our online identity and, while
                Medium offers a fantastic writing experience, it sacrifices other
                important values. Luckily, the Jamstack modern approach to running
                websites aligns with these ideals. Stackbit lets you import your blog
                and turn it into a Jamstack blog in minutes.
          - content: >-
                Own your data by storing it in a git repo and/or managing it with a
                Headless CMS, continuously integrate and deploy your website using
                Netlify and get a design and a Jamstack website provisioned in 60
                seconds with Stackbit. You can easily get by with free usage tiers or
                pay a reasonable fee for a higher level of service in the future. Most
                importantly, you control your data, how it's deployed and where it's
                used and you can always switch services without any sacrifice. Get on
                the Jamstack easily by importing your Medium blog to the Jamstack
                architecture with Stackbit.

                #### Import Your Medium Blog


                Luckily enough Medium has an export tool and we've done everything we
                can to make our importer support all the edge cases. For now Medium
                doesn't export (or endorse the scraping of) comments and we don't
                import drafts.
          - content: >-
                ![](/images/pick-stack.svg)


                #### Pick Your Stack


                This is the easy part - pick a Jamstack blog theme, a Static Site
                Generator (Gatsby is popular) and a Headless CMS (they all have free
                plans).
          - content: "![](/images/live-site.svg)\n\n#### Voilà! Your Jamstack Blog is Live \U0001F389\n\nWe stand corrected, this is the easy part. If you're new to the Jamstack we encourage you play with the Headless CMS you chose, everything has been wired for you behind the scenes."
