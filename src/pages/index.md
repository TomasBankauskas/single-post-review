          The web is evolving quickly. In a fragmented Jamstack environment,
          developers struggle to glue products together when trying out the latest
          tech. Stackbit connects the best tools on the market, and helps them play
          together.


          To start, pick a theme and make it your own, or upgrade your existing site
          — either way you'll go live in minutes. From there, Stackbit Studio helps
          you style your page, do inline editing and manage your content. It's
          easier than you think!

          Stackbit is the first, complete platform for the Jamstack. We bring the
          latest technologies under one roof and control them from one central
          place, making Jamstack truly accessible for the first time.


          Developers can build and maintain advanced sites, while marketers get to
          keep their favorite capabilities, minus the outdated ecosystems. Styling,
          publishing, inline content editing —  Jamstack is now as user friendly as
          it gets.

          Stackbit isn’t a walled garden and here you'll never be married to a
          "system." We believe that the web should be open, and respect the choices
          you make when building a website. That's why we help you set up and manage
          your tech, but steer clear of your critical path. Jamstack sites are the
          fastest, most secure ones the web, and Stackbit opens the door and makes
          this architecture available to all.


          You can bring your framework and Headless CMS or choose from the best
          available tools, and gain access to features you wouldn’t otherwise —
          whatever helps you make the web, better.
