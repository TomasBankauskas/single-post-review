          Stackbit makes managing modern websites accessible to anyone. Tasks like
          modifying a tagline, creating landing pages or publishing content changes
          at 6am no longer require a developer. The best part is that Stackbit
          builds upon your existing technology choices — so choosing Stackbit won't
          require an expensive, ground up rewrite of your site.

          Everything you need to manage your site is available directly on your site
          using the Stackbit widget which displays whenever you are signed-in to
          Stackbit.

          You are notified when content changes and can instantly view and share
          full previews. Preview links can either show real-time updates to content
          as it changes or a snapshot of the current state of edits.

          Never worry about content changes accidentally slipping into the live
          site. Stackbit's simple workflow ensures changes don't go live until you,
          or someone from your team, approves them.


          Approved changes can be published instantly or scheduled for a specified
          time in the future.

          Stackbit integrates directly with your CMS to let you make content changes
          on-page using an intuitive user experience.

          If you use tools like Google Docs, Airtable, Notion, Confluence, Stackbit
          will let you skip the error-prone copy-pasting steps and publish to your
          site using a simple workflow.

                We've developed a robust system which we call **RaaS (Render as a
                Service)** to power our consumer-grade experiences such as the
                previewing of content changes, live on-page editing and publishing
                workflows.

                Stackbit does not replace your existing hosting and devops but works
                in conjunction with them. This means that working with Stackbit
                doesn't add any risk to your website's uptime and availability, it
                just makes everything about working on the website easier and more
                productive.
